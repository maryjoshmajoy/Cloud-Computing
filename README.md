Project Introduction:
The Vancouver city features a variety of playing fields, from regulation-sized grass fields and artificial turf to non-regulation-sized gravel fields. All the Park Board's fields, courts, diamonds, and outdoor facilities—aside from artificial turf fields—are open for casual use on a first-come, first-served basis if they aren't closed for repair or being used by a permit holder. To utilize artificial grass fields, you need a permit. This dataset shows the playfields that are closed for maintenance. Field maintenance personnel inspect all grass fields to assess playability, repairs, and closures
