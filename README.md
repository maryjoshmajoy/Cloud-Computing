Project Description: exploratory data analysis on Weekend_play_field_status
Project Title: Closure details of Parks in City of Vancouver
Objective:
  This dataset shows the playfields that are closed for maintenance, number of people visited on weekends in each park. Field maintenance personnel inspect all grass fields to assess playability, repairs, and closures. The system's primary responsibility is to give information regarding the maintenance of the playing fields and turf with maximum clarity to people planning to visit the park. This system balances casual and permitted use while maintaining field conditions for community enjoyment.

  Park_id
Park_id: the unique identifier for parks
