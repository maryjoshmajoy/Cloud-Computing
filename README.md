Hai There,
I am Mary Joshma Joy MBA student in UCW explains the projects done in AWS Cloud Computing.


Project Introduction:

          The Vancouver city features a variety of playing fields, from regulation-sized grass fields and artificial turf to non-regulation-sized gravel fields. All the Park Board's fields, courts, diamonds, and outdoor facilities—aside from artificial turf fields—are open for casual use on a first-come, first-served basis if they aren't closed for repair or being used by a permit holder. To utilize artificial grass fields, you need a permit. This dataset shows the playfields that are closed for maintenance. Field maintenance personnel inspect all grass fields to assess playability, repairs, and closures. The system's primary responsibility is to give information regarding the maintenance of the playing fields and turf with maximum clarity to people planning to visit the park. This system balances casual and permitted use while maintaining field conditions for community enjoyment.
