# Cloud-Computing
Hai There,
I am Mary Joshma Joy MBA student in UCW explains the projects done in AWS Cloud Computing.
Project Introduction: 
  This dataset shows the playfields that are closed for maintenance, number of people visited on weekends in each park. Field maintenance personnel inspect all grass fields to assess playability, repairs, and closures. The system's primary responsibility is to give information regarding the maintenance of the playing fields and turf with maximum clarity to people planning to visit the park. This system balances casual and permitted use while maintaining field conditions for community enjoyment.
